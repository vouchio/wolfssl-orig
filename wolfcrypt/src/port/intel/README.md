# Intel QuickAssist Adapter Asynchronous Support

The wolfSSL / wolfCrypt libraries support hardware crypto acceleration using the Intel QuickAssist adapter. This software has been tested using QAT 1.6 in user space on Cent OS (Kernel 3.10.0-327.22.2.el7.x86_64) on an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4790 CPU @ 3.60GHz. Intel QuickAssist is DH895xCC (BDF=03:00.0, Stepping A0, device 0 is SKU2).

## Overview

Support has been added for wolfCrypt for RSA public/private (CRT/non-CRT), AES CBC/GCM, ECDH/ECDSA, DH, DES3, SHA, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512, MD5 and HMAC. RSA padding is done via software. The wolfCrypt tests and benchmarks have asynchronous support. The wolfCrypt benchmark tool support multi-threading. The wolfSSL SSL/TLS async support has been extended to include all PKI, Encryption/Decryption and hashing/HMAC. An async hardware simulator has been added to test the asynchronous support without hardware.

The Intel QuickAssist port files are located in `wolfcrypt/src/port/intel/quickassist.c` and `wolfssl/wolfcrypt/port/intel/quickassist.h`. The QuickAssist memory handling for NUMA and normal malloc is in `wolfcrypt/src/port/intel/quickassist_mem.c`.

The asynchronous crypto files are located at `wolfcrypt/src/async.c` and `wolfssl/wolfcrypt/async.h`. These files are not in the public repository. Please contact info@wolfssl.com if interested in our asynchronous support to request an evaluation.


## Building

QuickAssist drivers can be downloaded from Intel here:
https://01.org/intel-quick-assist-technology/downloads

### QAT 1.7

This page will always have the latest QAT 1.7 Linux release:
https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/30178

Note: If you have the older driver installed you may need to remove it or unload the module and reboot.

1. Setup `QAT1.7` and `wolfssl` next to each other in the same folder.

2. Build QAT 1.7

Prerequisites: 
`sudo apt-get install libudev-dev`
OR
`sudo yum install systemd-devel`

```sh
mkdir QAT1.7
cd QAT1.7
curl -o QAT1.7.L.4.14.0-00031.tar.gz https://downloadmirror.intel.com/30178/eng/QAT1.7.L.4.14.0-00031.tar.gz
tar -xvzf QAT1.7.L.4.14.0-00031.tar.gz
./configure
sudo make install
...
There is 3 QAT acceleration device(s) in the system:
 qat_dev0 - type: c6xx,  inst_id: 0,  node_id: 1,  bsf: 0000:84:00.0,  #accel: 5 #engines: 10 state: up
 qat_dev1 - type: c6xx,  inst_id: 1,  node_id: 1,  bsf: 0000:85:00.0,  #accel: 5 #engines: 10 state: up
 qat_dev2 - type: c6xx,  inst_id: 2,  node_id: 1,  bsf: 0000:86:00.0,  #accel: 5 #engines: 10 state: up
```

```sh
$ lspci -d 8086: | grep QuickAssist
84:00.0 Co-processor: Intel Corporation C62x Chipset QuickAssist Technology (rev 04)
85:00.0 Co-processor: Intel Corporation C62x Chipset QuickAssist Technology (rev 04)
86:00.0 Co-processor: Intel Corporation C62x Chipset QuickAssist Technology (rev 04)
```

If you are using the QAT hardware hashing, you may need to disable the params checking, which doesn't support a last partial with 0 length source input. Code runs and works, but parameter checking will fail.
Use `./configure --disable-param-check && sudo make install`

3. Change owner permissions for build output directory:
	
	`sudo chown [user]:[user] build`
	
	To manually startup the services you can use:
	
	```
	sudo modprobe usdm_drv
	sudo service qat_service start
	```

4. Build wolfSSL:
	
	```
	cd ../wolfssl
	./configure --with-intelqa=../QAT1.7 --enable-asynccrypt
	make
	```	
	

### QAT 1.6

1. Setup `QAT1.6` and `wolfssl` next to each other in the same folder.
2. Build the QAT 1.6:
  * Run the installer using `sudo ./installer.sh`
  * Choose option 3 to install.
  * After reboot you'll need to make sure and load the qaeMemDrv.ko module. `sudo insmod ./QAT1.6/build/qaeMemDrv.ko`
3. Build wolfSSL:
  * `./configure --enable-asynccrypt --with-intelqa=../QAT1.6 && make`

## Usage

Running wolfCrypt test and benchmark must be done with `sudo` to allow hardware access. By default the QuickAssist code uses the "SSL" process name via `QAT_PROCESS_NAME` in quickassist.h to match up to the hardware configuration.

Note: `sudo make check` will fail since default QAT configuration doesn't allow multiple concurrent processes to use hardware. You can run each of the make check scripts individually with sudo. The hardware configuration can be customized by editing the `QAT1.6/build/dh895xcc_qa_dev0.conf` file to allow multiple processes.

Here are some build options for tuning your use:

1. `QAT_USE_POLLING_CHECK`: Enables polling check to ensure only one poll per crypto instance.
2. `WC_ASYNC_THREAD_BIND`: Enables binding of thread to crypto hardware instance.
3. `WOLFSSL_DEBUG_MEMORY_PRINT`: Enables verbose malloc/free printing. This option is used along with `WOLFSSL_DEBUG_MEMORY` and `WOLFSSL_TRACK_MEMORY`.
4. `WC_ASYNC_THRESH_NONE`: Disables the default thresholds for determining if software AES/DES3 is used. Otherwise you can define `WC_ASYNC_THRESH_AES_CBC`, `WC_ASYNC_THRESH_AES_GCM` and `WC_ASYNC_THRESH_DES3_CBC` with your own values. The defaults are AES CBC: 1024, AES GCM 128, DES3 1024. If the symmetric operation is over this size it will use QAT hardware. Otherwise software.
5. `WC_ASYNC_NO_CRYPT`: When defined with disable QAT use for AES/DES3.
6. `WC_ASYNC_NO_HASH`: When defined disables the QAT for hashing (MD5,SHA,SHA256,SHA512).
7. `WC_ASYNC_NO_RNG`: When defined disables the QAT DRBG (default for QAT v1.7)
8. `WC_NO_ASYNC_THREADING`: Disables the thread affinity code for optionally linking a thread to a specific QAT instance. To use this feature you must also define `WC_ASYNC_THREAD_BIND`.
9. `WC_ASYNC_BENCH_THREAD_COUNT`: Use specific number of threads for benchmarking.
10. `QAT_HASH_ENABLE_PARTIAL`: Enables partial hashing support, which allows sending blocks to hardware prior to final. Otherwise all hash updates are cached.

The QuickAssist v1.6 driver uses its own memory management system in `quickassist_mem.c`. This can be tuned using the following defines:

1. `USE_QAE_STATIC_MEM`: Uses a global pool for the list of allocations. This improves performance, but consumes extra up front memory. The pre-allocation size can be tuned using `QAE_USER_MEM_MAX_COUNT`.
2. `USE_QAE_THREAD_LS` : Uses thread-local-storage and removes the mutex. Can improve performance in multi-threaded environment, but does use extra memory.

For QuickAssist v1.7 the newer usdm memory driver is used directly.

### Recommended wolfSSL Build Options

```sh
$ ./configure --with-intelqa=../QAT1.7 --enable-asynccrypt \
	--enable-aesni --enable-intelasm \
	--enable-sp --enable-sp-asm \
	CFLAGS="-DWC_ASYNC_NO_HASH"
```

* `--with-intelqa=../QAT1.7`: Enables the Intel QuickAssist mode.
* `--enable-asynccrypt`: Enables asynchronous cryptography mode.
* `--enable-aesni`: Enables the Intel AES-NI assembly speedups.
* `--enable-intelasm`: Enables the Intel ASM (AVX/AVX2) speedups.
* `--enable-sp`: Enable Single Precision math to speedup standard key sizes and curves.
* `--enable-sp-asm`: Enable Single Precision assembly speedups.
* `WC_ASYNC_NO_HASH`: Disable the QAT hashing and use Intel AVX accelerated software hashing. Overhead for using QAT hashing is not yet well tuned.


### wolfCrypt Test with QAT
